About
-----

Vertesaur is the accumulation of the computational geometry algorithms and data structures required to support current and future projects. The data structures are intended to be reasonably independent of any one specific industry yet useful to many. The library is designed to run on the CLR and with .NET 4.0. Because this library is currently designed to support new projects there is little reason to put effort into supporting older versions of the framework and CLR.
